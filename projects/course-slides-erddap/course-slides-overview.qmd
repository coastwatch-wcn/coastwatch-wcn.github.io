This project demonstrates a **non-traditional use of ERDDAP**: not just as a public data portal, but as a secure, searchable database and image server that can feed an end-to-end automation workflow. Authorized users can query participant metadata from NOAA CoastWatch satellite training courses, download the matching slide PNGs, and automatically assemble a custom PowerPoint deck, all while keeping personally identifiable information (PII) protected behind authentication.

Importantly, the tutorials associated with this project are designed so users can adapt this workflow to their own password-protected ERDDAP datasets, not just the CoastWatch example shown here.

## Why this matters: access control + automation don’t usually mix

ERDDAP is commonly used for open discovery and reuse (public datasets, anonymous access). But some datasets must be restricted, especially when they contain **PII**, internal reporting metrics, or unpublished materials.

Manual login works for interactive browsing, but becomes a blocker for reproducible scripts and automated reporting.

This project shows a practical pattern for bridging that gap:

**Interactive browser login once → authenticated scripted access for the rest of the workflow.**

## The CoastWatch Satellite Training Course Overview

- CoastWatch offers satellite data training workshops each year
- Participants are asked to submit a project summary slide and the end of the course
- Slides capture satellite use and participant/project metadata
  - Slides contain PII → access is restricted
- Goal: Allow authorized users to generate presentations from an automated workflow

Over **250 participant slides** have been collected since 2013 (and growing).

## The CoastWatch Slide Archive Problem 

::: {.course-slides-columns}
::: {.course-slides-column}

### Then

- Slides scattered across shared drives/folders  
- Inconsistent naming and organization  
- Manual discovery (slow, error-prone, and knowledge-dependent)  
- Difficult to summarize course impact across years

### Now

- Slides and metadata hosted in ERDDAP  
- Fully searchable by **course, year, affiliation, products, topics, software**, etc.  
- Slide IDs link metadata to image files  
- “Find participant work instantly” → supports reporting + impact documentation

## ERDDAP used in nonconventional ways

::: {.course-slides-columns}
::: {.course-slides-column}
### 1) ERDDAP as a searchable database (metadata)

A password-protected **tabledap** dataset acts like a structured, queryable registry of participant information and slide IDs.

Instead of just serving environmental measurements, ERDDAP here functions as:

- A relational-style metadata store  
- A searchable reporting backend  
- A structured index for downstream automation

### 2) ERDDAP as an authenticated image server

A second dataset indexes a folder of PNG slide files and exposes them through predictable URLs.

Once authenticated, scripts can:

- Construct file URLs dynamically from Slide IDs  
- Retrieve slide PNGs directly  
- Batch-download content for automated reporting  

This transforms ERDDAP from a “data API” into a **controlled asset distribution system**.

## How secure access is implemented

ERDDAP is configured for:

- **Google-based authentication**
- **Role-based dataset access**
- Dataset-level permission control

Users:

1. Log in using NOAA-authorized Google accounts  
2. Are assigned roles within ERDDAP  
3. Gain access only to approved datasets  

No credentials are stored in scripts.

## What this enables

Authorized users can generate:

- Course impact summaries  
- Program reviews by year or affiliation  
- Thematic decks (e.g., “Ocean Color + Telemetry projects”)  
- Internal reporting materials  
- Presentation-ready slide decks  

All without manually searching folders.

## Strengths and limitations

::: {.course-slides-columns}
::: {.course-slides-column}
### Strengths

- Uses existing ERDDAP infrastructure  
- Secure identity-based access  
- No stored credentials  
- Reproducible + auditable  
- Demonstrates ERDDAP versatility beyond environmental grids  
:::
::: {.course-slides-column}
### Limitations

- Requires interactive login (Selenium)  
- Not fully headless unless extended  
- Sensitive to ERDDAP dataset restructuring  
- Depends on role-based permissions being configured correctly

## Why ERDDAP versatility matters

This project is a blueprint for other secure workflows:

- Internal asset archives  
- Image repositories  
- Metadata registries  
- Protected environmental products  
- Program tracking dashboards  

It demonstrates that ERDDAP can function as:

- A data API  
- A metadata database  
- A file server  
- A reporting backend  

Not just a public data catalog.
