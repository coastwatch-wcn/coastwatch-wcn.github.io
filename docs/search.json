If the website data is behind, it runs subordinate scripts (update_total_indicator_2025.py, plot_total_tool_2025.py, & make_monthly_maps_2025.py) to update the indicator time series, regenerate the indicator plot, and create new monthly maps. After updates, it builds a small web_data.json file used by the dashboard to display alert status, forecast month, latest index value, and last update date.

It compares the scraped advisory date to the locally stored JSON file and only updates if a newer advisory is available (unless a custom date is specified). When new data is found, it writes a dated archive JSON file and updates the primary elnino_last.json file used by the website.

    "text": "The mission of our project is to bring best-available science and analyses to support the ecological sustainability and economic viability for U.S. ocean users. With decades of experience in endangered species protection, marine resource management, and oceanographic and species distribution analyses, our research team is working to support the development of innovative management approaches that meet ecological and economic management objectives and mandates.\nBlue whales are an Endangered Species, with roughly 1500 whales estimated in the migratory Eastern North Pacific Population off of the U.S. West Coast. This population is threatened by ship strikes, which are the largest source of mortality, as well as bycatch in fishing gear. WhaleWatch 2.0 is a predictive spatial management tool that helps scientists and managers evaluate the most likely times and places that blue whales will be present along the U.S. West Coast in order to inform management decisions and mitigate risk of ship strikes, bycatch, or other threats. This is the latest dynamic model for blue whales. Previous models for blue whales in the California Current Ecosystem include the original WhaleWatch effort and a climatological ensemble model that provides a best seasonal estimate from multiple data sources and modeling approaches.\n\n\n\n\nFunding has been provided by:\n\nBenioff Ocean Initiative\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal on Earth.

Dynamic ocean management can use diverse analytical approaches (simple to complex), supports climate-resilient fisheries, and is already implemented in many oceans around the world.\n\n\nTraditional Ocean Management\n\nBoundaries are fixed in space and time.\nStatic schemes must be large enough to capture broad-scale ocean processes.\nCan have high opportunity costs for fishers.\nRendered ineffective during anomalous events (e.g. species seasonal migrations or shifts of fishing fleets).\n\nDynamic Ocean Management\n\nBoundaries and recommendations can change in near real time.\nAlign management actions with the variability of ecosystems.\nIncorporates diverse data sources:\n\nSatellite data\nOcean monitoring arrays\nBio-geochemical models\nCrowd-sourced reports from ocean users\n\nProvides managers with recommendations that reflect current marine conditions.\n\n\n\n\nDynamic ocean management sits at the interface of science and management.

A species is assigned a more negative weighting to avoid catch and a more positive weighting when catch is desired. For example, the default weightings (see map legend) are set to 0.9 for swordfish and -0.9 for leatherback turtles, creating a map that locates fishing areas where the chance of swordfish catch is optimal and the bycatch of leatherbacks, a protected and endangered species, is minimal. If there were elevated sea lion bycatch events, the weighting for that species (set to -0.05 by default) could be made more negative in order to locate fishing areas where the chance of their bycatch is less.

    "text": "Photo copyright: NOAA Fisheries\n\n\n\n\n\nLoggerhead turtles reach maturity at about 35 years, but can live 50 years or more. Females lay about four clutches of eggs during the nesting season, each with 100-120 eggs. When the hatchlings emerge from the nests, they quickly move across the beach to the surf and swim offshore. Post-hatchling and juvenile loggerheads can travel great distances to reach food-rich coastal areas, where they remain until they mature. Adults return to nest at the beach where they hatched, known as the natal beach. The North Pacific population of loggerhead turtles in Southern California waters are juveniles that crossed the entire Pacific Ocean from natal beaches in Japan. They migrate back to natal beaches to nest and then remain in the Western Pacific Ocean as adults.\n\n\n\n\nStrandings of loggerheads are rare events along the Pacific coast of North America. Since 1980, approximately 60 reports of stranded loggerheads have been recorded for the U.S. west coast and Alaska. Most stranded animals were found south of Point Conception within the northern extent of the Southern California Bight. The causes were largely undetermined, although entrainment in coastal power plants, entanglement in marine debris and fishing gear, and health-related incidents have been reported.\nThe unintentional capture of loggerheads during commercial fishing activities, or bycatch, has been documented off the U.S. West Coast only for the California large-mesh drift gillnet fishery that targets swordfish and thresher sharks. Since the federal observer program began documenting protected species interactions in this fishery in 1990, 16 observations of bycaught loggerheads have been recorded. All of the interactions took place south of Point Conception, and the loggerheads taken were most likely early and late oceanic stage juveniles.\n\n\n\nThe loggerhead turtle was listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as threatened throughout its range on 28 July 1978. Following a review by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 9 distinct population segments were identified. In 2011, five of these populations were reclassified as endangered under the ESA. This includes the North Pacific population, which ranges from the East China Sea to the waters off California and Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe California drift gillnet (DGN) fishery for swordfish and thresher shark is federally managed under the Federal Fishery Management Plan for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species (HMS FMP), implemented in 2004. The fishery is also managed by California and Oregon via regulations to conserve target and non-target species. A drift gillnet is an unanchored panel of stretched mesh (14 inches or greater) suspended vertically in the water by floats along the top and weights along the bottom. Regulations require large mesh drift gillnet fishing off the West Coast to be equipped with acoustic pingers and extenders (&gt; 36 ft. buoy lines to protect marine mammals).\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto copyright: NOAA Fisheries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DGN fishery has been subject to a number of seasonal closures. Since 1982, it has been closed inside the entire U.S. West Coast exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from February 1 to April 30 of each year. In 1986, a closure was established within 75 miles of the California mainland from June 1 through Aug 14 of each year to conserve common thresher sharks; this closure was extended to include May in 1990 and later years.\nNOAA Fisheries designated two Pacific sea turtle conservation areas off the U.S. West Coast with seasonal restrictions on the DGN fishery to protect endangered sea turtles. The larger of the two conservation areas, created in 2001, spans the EEZ north of Point Conception, CA (34°27’ N. latitude) to mid-Oregon (45° N. latitude) and west to 129° W. longitude. DGN fishing is prohibited annually within this conservation area from August 15 to November 15 to protect leatherback sea turtles. A smaller conservation area located south of Point Conception, CA, and east of 120° W. longitude was created in 2003, and amended in 2007, to protect Pacific loggerhead turtles (Federal Register 72 FR 31756). Within this conservation area, fishing with DGN gear is prohibited from June 1 – August 31 of each year during a forecasted or occurring El Niño event. DGN closures have been implemented three times, in 2014, 2015, and 2016, since the creation of the Pacific loggerhead conservation area.\nThe number of active vessels in the DGN fishery has remained under 50 vessels since 2003, and there has been an average of 20 active vessels per year from 2010 through 2015. Since 1990, NMFS has targeted 20 percent observer coverage of the DGN fishery each year, per recommendations from the Southwest Fisheries Science Center. The NMFS fleet-wide observer coverage target has been 30 percent since 2013. Since some DGN vessels are unobservable due to safety or accommodations requirements, the observable vessels are observed at a rate higher than 30 percent to attain the fleet-wide 30 percent coverage. Four to six DGN vessels have been unobservable during each fishing season from 2011 to present.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\n\nLoggerhead turtles resources – NOAA Office of Protected Resources\n\nBycatch information – NOAA Office of Protected Resources\n\nEl Niño diagnostics – NOAA Climate Prediction Center\n\nLoggerhead conservation fishing closures notices 2014 | 2015 | 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedback / Contact Us\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\nSubmit Comments\n\n\nClear Form"

The map shows where whales are most likely to be each day based on current environmental conditions, such as ocean temperature and productivity.\n\n\n\nHow do I use the WhaleWatch 2.0 Map?\n\nBetter blue whale habitat is indicated by increasingly red colors, showing where the likelihood of blue whale presence is higher. Poorer blue whale habitat is indicated by increasingly blue colors, showing where the likelihood of blue whale presence is lower. If blues whales are present in the area, the map indicates where they are most likely to be.\n\n\n\nHow is the WhaleWatch 2.0 Map product made?\n\nEach day the WhaleWatch 2.0 tool generates predictions of the spatial distributions of blue whales based on an ensemble of models predicting blue whale habitat suitability from current ocean conditions. For detailed methodology of model building, see the study published about the product. This is an update to the previous WhaleWatch effort that was at 25km resolution and updated monthly (URL).\n\n\n\nWhat environmental data are used?\n\nDaily ocean conditions such as sea surface temperature, locations of frontal zones, and water column properties are sourced from a near-real-time data-assimilative configuration of the Regional Ocean Modeling System for the California Current System.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Channel Islands Shipping Lane Indicator?\n\nThis indicator shows daily whale habitat suitability within the primary shipping approach north of the Channel islands and the southern undesignated approach in the Southern California Bight. This type of information allows managers to understand shipstrike risk exposure in shipping lanes within and among years as a function of environmental conditions, allowing for informed decision-making regarding vessel speed reductions.\n\n\n\nLocation of the shipping approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information on this page may be used and redistributed freely, but is not intended for legal use.

    "text": "Information and Course Dates\nAre you interested in using oceanographic satellite data in your work but don’t know where to start? The NOAA CoastWatch program offers in-person and online courses where participants learn about environmental satellite data and how to easily obtain it. Participants also gain hands on experience working with the data of interest to them. A major goal of the course is to provide scientists who are not regular users of satellite data with the knowledge and tools they need to incorporate satellite data into their research and management projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nDocuments\n\n\nCourse Information and Registration\nSatellite Training Materials\nERDDAP, R and Python Tutorials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the course structured?\n\nThe course consists of both instructional materials and virtual workshops. The instructional materials introduce participants to the different types of environmental satellite data, including ocean color, sea surface temperature, sea surface height, salinity, and ocean surface winds.\nIn the workshops, participants are provided with individual and group assistance to use tools to locate online satellite data at the spatial and temporal coverage appropriate to their needs and download the data into the software of their choice. We generally focus on R, ArcGIS, and Python, because of the popularity of these software packages, however participants using other software packages are also welcome.\nParticipants are expected to come to the course with a specific project to work on during the workshops. For example, if their project is to merge tagged animal tracks with satellite data, they should bring track data with them. Participants get more out of the workshop if they have specific questions or projects to work on.\n\n\n\nWho should take the course?\n\nThe courses are geared towards National Marine Fisheries Service and National Ocean Service scientists, but non-NOAA participants are welcome if space permits. Hundreds of people have taken this course, with participants from each of the six fisheries science centers, many of the marine sanctuaries, as well as other government agencies such as the US Coast Guard, US Geological Survey and the US Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThere is no fee associated with the course, but participants will be requested to submit a single PowerPoint slide that discribes the projects they worked on during the course.\n\n\n\nWhere were past courses held?\n\nDates and locations of past courses\n\n\n\nDate\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n4/2020\nUSGS Anchorage, Online\n\n\n2/2020\nUniversity of Puerto Rico, San Juan\n\n\n9/2019\nTexas A & M, Galveston\n\n\n8/2018\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle\n\n\n8/2017\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle\n\n\n8/2016\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle\n\n\n8/2015\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle\n\n\n8/2014\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle\n\n\n8/2013\nOregon State University, Corvallis\n\n\n3/2012\nNOS Coastal Services, Charleston, SC\n\n\n3/2011\nOregon State University, Corvallis\n\n\n8/2010\nPeninsula College, Monterey, CA\n\n\n8/2009\nPeninsula College, Monterey, CA\n\n\n3/2008\nOregon State University, Corvallis\n\n\n3/2007\nOregon State University, Corvallis\n\n\n8/2006\nOregon State University, Corvallis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen and where is the next course?\n\nFor the dates and locations of upcoming courses, please review the course offerings at the following link: https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cwn/training-courses.html\nTo be notified about future courses, contact Cara Wilson or sign-up for course updates using the form on this page."

    "text": "This project demonstrates a non-traditional use of ERDDAP: not just as a public data portal, but as a secure, searchable database and image server that can feed an end-to-end automation workflow. Authorized users can query participant metadata from NOAA CoastWatch satellite training courses, download the matching slide PNGs, and automatically assemble a custom PowerPoint deck, all while keeping personally identifiable information (PII) protected behind authentication.\nImportantly, the tutorials associated with this project are designed so users can adapt this workflow to their own password-protected ERDDAP datasets, not just the CoastWatch example shown here.\n\n\n\nERDDAP is commonly used for open discovery and reuse (public datasets, anonymous access). But some datasets must be restricted, especially when they contain PII, internal reporting metrics, or unpublished materials.\nManual login works for interactive browsing, but becomes a blocker for reproducible scripts and automated reporting.\nThis project shows a practical pattern for bridging that gap:\nInteractive browser login once → authenticated scripted access for the rest of the workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA password-protected tabledap dataset acts like a structured, queryable registry of participant information and slide IDs.\nInstead of just serving environmental measurements, ERDDAP here functions as:\n\nA relational-style metadata store\n\nA searchable reporting backend\n\nA structured index for downstream automation\n\n\n\n\nA second dataset indexes a folder of PNG slide files and exposes them through predictable URLs.\nOnce authenticated, scripts can:\n\nConstruct file URLs dynamically from Slide IDs\n\nRetrieve slide PNGs directly\n\nBatch-download content for automated reporting\n\nThis transforms ERDDAP from a “data API” into a controlled asset distribution system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastWatch offers satellite data training workshops each year, during which participants are asked to submit a project summary slide at the conclusion of the course. These sides document how satellite data were used and capture important participant and project metadata. Because the slides include personally identifiable information (PII), access must be restricted. The goal of this project is to allow authorized users to generate presentations from these archived slides through a secure, automated workflow.\nOver 250 participant slides have been collected since 2013 and the archive continues to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample participant project slide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore this project, participant slides were scattered across shared drives and folders, often with inconsistent naming conventions and organization.

As the archive grew, it became increasingly difficult to retrieve examples from specific years, topics, or participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter this project, slides and associated metadata are hosted in ERDDAP, where they can be searched and filtered by course, year, affiliation, products, topics, software, and more. Each slide ID links structured metadata directly to its corresponding image file, allowing authorized users to retrieve participant work instantly. This supports documentation of course impact and the generation of presentation-ready materials through an automated workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo secure access to restricted datasets, ERDDAP must first be configured to authenticate users.

The project demonstrates that ERDDAP can function as far more than a public data catalog.
