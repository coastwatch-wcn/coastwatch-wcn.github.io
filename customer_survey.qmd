<p>In accordance with Executive Order 12862, the National Performance Review, and good management practices, NOAA offices want to determine whether their customers are satisfied with the services and products they are receiving, and whether they have suggestions as to how the services and products may be improved or made more useful. The information will be used to improve NOAA's products and services.</p>

<p>Responses to this survey will not be treated as official correspondence to the agency, so you may not receive a reply from NOAA. Do not use this survey to provide public comments on rulemakings, respond to solicitations, or communicate about any official agency action. Instead, provide your comments or feedback as described in the action you want to respond to, or use a designated channel for official comments (for example, www.regulations.gov to comment on notices of rulemaking).</p>

<p>Responding to this survey is completely voluntary. No confidentiality can be provided for responses, and you need not supply your name or address. Any information you provide will be used to for the sole purpose of improving NOAA's products and services.</p>

<p>Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 5 minutes. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to:</p>
